Project Structure
This project consists of Python scripts covering various tasks related to lists, tuples, and their manipulation. Each task has its own script and follows specific requirements and guidelines.

Scripts are written in Python 3.8.5 and follow PEP8 guidelines.
Each script has a corresponding test script for validation.
Tasks
Print a list of integers: Write a function to print all integers of a list.
Secure access to an element in a list: Implement a function to retrieve an element from a list.
Replace element: Write a function to replace an element of a list at a specific position.
Print a list of integers... in reverse!: Implement a function to print all integers of a list in reverse order.
Replace in a copy: Write a function to replace an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
Lists of lists = Matrix: Implement a function to print a matrix of integers.
Tuples addition: Write a function to add two tuples.
More returns!: Implement a function to return a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
Find the max: Write a function to find the biggest integer of a list.
Only by 2: Implement a function to find all multiples of 2 in a list.
Delete at: Write a function to delete the item at a specific position in a list.
Switch: Complete the source code to switch the value of two variables.
Linked list palindrome: Write a function in C to check if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
CPython #0: Python lists: Create a C function to print basic info about Python lists.
