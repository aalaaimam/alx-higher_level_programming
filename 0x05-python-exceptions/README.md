# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## Description
This project contains Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts related to errors and exceptions handling in Python. Each script solves a specific task, and they cover topics such as safe list printing, safe printing of integers, handling exceptions during division, and more.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All scripts should end with a new line
- The first line of all scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The code should follow PEP 8 style (use `pycodestyle` version 2.8.*)
- All scripts must be executable
- The length of the files will be tested using `wc`
