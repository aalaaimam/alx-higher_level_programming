Project: 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
This project covers the basics of Python programming, focusing on control flow structures like if/else statements, loops (while and for), and functions. Below is a summary of the tasks completed in this project along with their descriptions and requirements.

Tasks Completed:
Positive anything is better than negative nothing: A Python script that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

The last digit: A Python script that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number along with additional information.

I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game: A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase.

When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off: A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

Hexadecimal printing: A Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.

00...99: A Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 99 with two digits, separated by commas.

islower: A Python function that checks if a character is lowercase.

To uppercase: A Python function that prints a string in uppercase.

There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important: A Python function that prints the last digit of a number.

a + b: A Python function that adds two integers and returns the result.

a ^ b: A Python function that computes the power of a number.

Fizz Buzz: A Python function that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

Insert in sorted linked list: A C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

Smile in the mirror: A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating between lowercase and uppercase letters.

Remove at position: A Python function that creates a copy of a string, removing a character at a specified position.

ByteCode -> Python #2: A Python function that mimics the behavior of a given Python bytecode.

man or help: python3
Project Structure:
Python Scripts: All scripts should end with .py extension and follow PEP8 guidelines.
README.md: Contains project description, tasks summary, and any additional information.
Execution Environment: Scripts should be executable on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
Testing: Test cases provided in main files can be used for validating script functionalities.
Requirements:
Scripts should start with #!/usr/bin/python3.
Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) should be used for style checks.
All files must be executable and end with a new line.
Maintain header files with function prototypes and include guards.
Follow specified guidelines for C scripts including no global variables and limited functions per file.
